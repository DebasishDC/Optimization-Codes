# Optimization-Codes
These are Stochastic Optimization Codes by using various Techniques to optimize the function/Feature Selection.

Codes are written in Python Language.

All the codes are written from scratch to improve the coding skills and for better under standing of Stochastic Optimization Algorithms.

I have written this codes in 2019, while pursuing Masters in Modeling and Simulation.

Name of the Algorithm mentioned as the file name. Please free to reach me if you find difficulty to understand the codes.
